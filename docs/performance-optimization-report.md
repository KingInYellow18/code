## Integration Architecture

### Optimized Authentication Manager

The `OptimizedAuthManager` serves as the central integration point for all performance optimizations:

```rust
pub struct OptimizedAuthManager {
    // Core authentication components
    unified_auth: Arc<UnifiedAuthManager>,
    agent_coordinator: Arc<AgentAuthCoordinator>,
    
    // Performance optimization components
    performance_coordinator: Arc<PerformanceCoordinator>,
    auth_cache: Arc<AuthenticationCache>,
    token_optimizer: Arc<TokenOptimizer>,
    connection_pool: Arc<ClaudeConnectionPool>,
    memory_optimizer: Arc<MemoryOptimizer>,
    performance_monitor: Arc<PerformanceMonitor>,
}
```

**Integration Benefits:**
- **Seamless Integration:** Works with existing authentication system without breaking changes
- **Configurable Optimizations:** All optimizations can be enabled/disabled independently
- **Performance Monitoring:** Real-time visibility into all optimization components
- **Automatic Fallbacks:** Graceful degradation when optimizations fail

### Performance Coordinator

Central coordination of all performance components:

```rust
impl PerformanceCoordinator {
    // Coordinates all optimization components
    pub async fn record_metrics(&self, metrics: PerformanceMetrics);
    pub async fn meets_performance_targets(&self) -> PerformanceReport;
    pub fn get_cache(&self) -> Arc<AuthenticationCache>;
    pub fn get_connection_pool(&self) -> Arc<ClaudeConnectionPool>;
    pub fn get_memory_optimizer(&self) -> Arc<MemoryOptimizer>;
}
```
