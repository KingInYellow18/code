- **Real-time Usage Tracking**: Atomic operations ensure thread-safe usage tracking
- **Conservative Allocation**: Allocates 50% of available quota for safety buffer
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Expired quotas cleaned up hourly with resource recovery
- **Concurrent Enforcement**: Hard limits prevent system overload

### 🛡️ Security Implementation
- **Secure File Storage**: 0o600 permissions on authentication files
